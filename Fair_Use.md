# Fair Use?
### Investigating the Fair Use of Pogo's video *Bloom*
*Written by Tiffany Smith*

*Bloom* is one of YouTuber Pogo's many videos that remix Disney movies into new songs and videos (visit his channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn-K7GIs62ENvdQe6ZZk9-w)).  He does many other remixed music videos, but the Disney ones are by far the most popular (and my personal favorite). The 2011 video *Bloom* features snippits from Disney's *Alice in Wonderland*, *Sleeping Beauty*, *Mary Poppins*, *Aladdin*, *Peter Pan*, *Cinderella*, *The Little Mermaid*, and *Snow White*. The musical numbers from these 8 movies have been altered dramatically and matched to a new beat to create a song. The videos are short clips sped up, slowed down, or repeated in tempo to go along with the song. Click on the thumbnail below to check it out.

### So is this fair use?
Now that you have watched the video, lets analyze it's fair use. U.S. Code Title 17 Section 107 describes the four main factors that are considered when determining fair use. A more comprehensive list with examples is on [Stanford University's Library](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/), which I will be using to argue *Bloom*'s fair use case.

##### Purpose and Character
The material may be considered fair use if it has been "transformed" to have a new meaning, asthetics, or if it is being used for education. 

Pogo's video *Bloom* is not being used for education, and is still in the same media as the original movies- video- but it does have a new meaning and expression. He is using the clips to create a new song and video that is expressing his own ideas, and not those conveyed in the original movies. In Pogo's work the characters and video displayed are secondary to the music, while Disney's music is written to compliment and enhance the development of a character. 

##### Nature of the Copyrighted Work
If the copyrighted work has a factual basis or has already been published by the creater/owner the use is more likely to be declared fair. Spreading facts is considered beneficial to the public and if a work has already been published, the owner has controlled the first public appearance and expression of their work. 

The original movies are published fictional works from Disney. Disney released their movies long before Pogo made his remixes, and has been controlling their publicity ever since. Disney can be very picky about who uses their copyrighted material and what it is being used for, but I believe Pogo's remix would fall under fair use becasue it would be categorized as a music video rather than a musical or movie. His video is not trying to tell a story, it is simply to make visuals for an extremely remixed song. As stated previously, the music is the focus of Pogo's videos, while Disney's movies are focused on the characters and the story.

##### Amount and Substainality of the Portion Used
In fair use, less is more. Small amounts of the copyrighted work, if those pieces that don't contain the "heart" or most memorable part of the work, are often ruled fair use.  

There are several ways Pogo should clear this factor. 
*  The length of the clips used are only a few seconds at most
*  The video in whole is a mere fraction of the length of any of the individual movies
*  None of the clips take the "heart" or meaning of the original movies
*  Many of the clips have the speed and/or pitch altered, separating them from the original form.

##### Market Effect
A very important factor is if the use will deprive or undermine the original work's profits at market. Does the use have a potential market to profit from?  

Pogo's remixed music video in no way will effect Disney's market. He has >6 million views on his video *Bloom* after 5 years of being online, so he could potentially make money through advertisements, but his video is not going to stop people from watching a full Disney movie, going to Disney World, or buying their merchandise. If it has any effect it would be a positive one, featuring several movies in one video could pique someones curiousity about a movie they have yet to see.

It is possible that Disney might be interested in making mashups of their own soundtracks to be used as advertisement or potentially sell. Pogo's video doesn't represent the image that Disney wants to send to people, and it also doesn't misrepresent or harm Disney's reputation. In short, if Disney wanted to be in the music mashup business, Pogo's video still wouldn't have much of an impact on that market. His expressions and techniques are unique to him, he just used Disney's music as a foundation and inspiration for his work, in the same way most other artists create new pieces.

##### Decision

The characters and partial tunes in *Bloom* are still recognizable as Disney's property, but as a whole, the music video has more differences than similarities. The style of music is nothing like any of the musical numbers Disney has written for their movies and the video clips occur in such small, sporatic pieces that the plot of the movie is hardly shown.

Let's recap the four factors of fair use and where *Bloom* stands with them:  

|  | Not fair Use | Not Clear | Definitely Fair Use |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| __Purpose & Character__ |  |  | x |  
| __Nature of the Work__ |  | x |  |  
| __Amount & Substantiality__ |  |  | x |  
| __Market Effect__ |  |  | x |  

My ruling:  
Pogo's music video *Bloom* is...
#### Fair Use!
